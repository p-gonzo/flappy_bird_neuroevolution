## Install
- `pipenv --three`
- `pipenv install`

## Run
- `pipenv run python game.py`

## Caveats:

- Running pygame on a Macbook with a Retina Display causes major slowdown issues

### Solution

- Lower your resolution
- Install [EasyRes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easyres/id688211836?mt=12) (A handy taskbar resolution switcher)
- Set your resolution to any of the `Standard (1x)` varieties
- I use `Standard (1x) - 1440 x 900`
